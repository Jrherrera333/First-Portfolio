        <p class="AboutMe" id="am">About Me</p>
        <div class="AboutMetx"> I am a husband, father of two very active boys and passionate for technology. My first exposure to the field of computer science was in an IT program held by NPower. After completing the program I was hired as a computer lab manager at IDAAY. Some years after moving to Maine I enrolled in Colorado Technical Institute. I realized I wanted to be a developer. This year I enrolled in a web developer bootcamp at UPenn. It was intense and exciting. The program is well put together and has taught me more than I thought I would learn. </div>
